# Learning silhouettes with group sparse autoencoders
Official code repository for "[Learning silhouettes with group sparse autoencoders](https://manosth.github.io/files/papers/TheodosisBa_SilhouetteLearning_ICASSP23.pdf)", a paper accepted at the [IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 2023](https://2023.ieeeicassp.org).

It consists of an unfolded architecture for learning networks with a group nonlinearity. The unsupervised architecture learns class specific "silhouettes" for atoms, which are representative of each class.

To train type `python3 main.py`.
